## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

It wasn't that complicated of a challenge, but I did have to be thorough with some details that came out disproportionately when writing the styles. I'm proud of the shading I add to the card and buttons. When I used Grid Layout everything was easier to combine.

### Continued development

I have improved a lot with Grid-Layout and Flexbox, before I could not distinguish their properties and it was all by luck, now I can better understand each of their functions. So this project was easier for me to execute, but I still think the design can be further improved and I want to learn.
